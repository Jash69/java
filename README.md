#### Java LAB Collection

Note: When downloading and running one of the programs, be sure to rename the program to `Main.java`

_For example:_ `1.java` will become `Main.java`

Then type `javac Main.java` to compile and `java Main` to run.
If you're not in the directory then try `javac [DRAG AND DROP FILE]` and then `java Main`.
